# University of Lincoln School of Computer Science Offer Holder Day Activity

That was a mouthful..

  

## Welcome!


Hello and a warm welcome to the School of Computer Science at the University of Lincoln. We're delighted to have you here today! Today will _hopefully_ give you a small taste of what we get up to as a school - whilst also letting you go ham on a cool little device.

In front of you is a Badger 2040 - a programable badge with an E-Ink display (like the ones you see on a Kindle) and powered by the RP2040 Microcontroller - Raspberry Pi's answer to the Arduino. We'll talk about the specifics later. All you need to know is that today we will be writing and pushing some code onto these devices to make a pretty nifty name badge, and yes, you can take it home with you!

## The Task
### Overview
We're going to be using an IDE called Thonny to write and upload our code to the Badger. Devices powered by the RP2040 Microcontroller can utilise a flavour of Python called Micropython. Micropyhton is great as it leverages the simplicity of Python code, as well as a majority of libraries availale under Python, whilst being optimised for use on a microcontroller.  

Our end goal is getting our badges to display a namebadge for ourselves, which can be customised and hacked further down the line, as and when you decide to give it a fresh new look!

### Step 1: Getting Started


## Glossary
| Acronym/Term | Meaning |
|--|--|
| IDE | Integrated Development Environment - where we write and manage code |
| RP2040 | A Rasberry Pi developed microcontroller with a dual core 133MHz ARM Cortex M0 CPU
| Microcontroller | A CPU like device which is more speciallised for low power, low cost use cases
| E-Ink Display | A display which uses charged ink particles to produce a display, doesn't require constant refreshing
| Library | Prebuilt Python files that allow you to quickly implement functionality without having to do it yourself
